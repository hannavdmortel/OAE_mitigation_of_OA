Code and data used for the paper 'Substantial limitations of ocean alkalinity enhancement in mitigating the negative impacts of ocean acidification on marine calcifiers' by van de Mortel et al. (2025).

Code implemented mainly in Python, and also partially in Matlab.

'master_data and 'control_conditions' (compiled from existing studies) are used as data input files for the script 'TA_addition'.
The output file of TA_addition is 'output_TA_addition' and this is used to run 'regression_model_plots'.
The output figures of 'regression_model_plots' are given in the 'Figures' folder.
This code was written by Hanna van de Mortel.

The 'Mitigation time' folder includes an inputs and outputs folder. 
The inputs folder includes the OceanSODA dataset, Table 1 values and matlab codes.
The outputs folder includes the created figures. 
This code was written by Greg Pelletier.
